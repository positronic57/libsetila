/**
* \page bdc_module Basic Data Containers
*
* Basic Data Containers module is a set of few templates for data structures that can be use for 
* storing data read from SPI/I2C devices: 
*
*  - \ref Stack "stack"  
*  - \ref CircularBuffer "circular buffer" 
*  - \ref FIFO_queue "first in first out (FIFO) queue".
*
*
* The implementations are not thread safe. 
* 
* Basic Operations 
* 
* Functions: addElement() and getElement() are defined for adding/removing data to/from  
* the data structures. Exception is the stack implementation where those two basic data 
* operations are implemented as push() for adding elements, and pop() for removing elements  
* from the stack. 
*
* 
* FIFO queue class has const \ref bdc_iterator "interator" defined. Although it is not a standard way of 
* accessing elements from queue data structures, it can be used for iterating over all of the elements 
* in the internal buffer for troubleshooting purposes. 
*
*
* The \ref BDC_STATE "status codes" for all of those operations are standardised accross the  
* templates.  
*
* 
* Buffer Size 
* 
*
* By default, the data containers allocate memory for 32 elements. 
* This value can be changed using the size argument of the corresponding  
* constructors. 
* 
* Practical example that demonstrates the use of FIFO_queue for storing data readings from BMP085 sensor 
* can be found in bmp085_bmp180.cpp. 
*
