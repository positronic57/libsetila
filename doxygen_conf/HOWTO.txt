To generate the project documentation based on "doxygen" comments in the code,
use the "doxygen" tool (available in the repositories of almost any Linux distribution)
from the command line. 

First navigate to "doxygen_config" folder within "libsetila" project folder:

  >cd doxygen_config

and execute the command:

  >doxygen ./doxyfile_libsetila

The documentation will be generated in "doc" folder in HTML format.
Open "index.html" in your favorite browser.
