Libsetila library is distributed with two examples for ST L3GD20 sensor:
  - l3gd20_single_meas_example.cpp: demonstrates a reading of angular rates in X, Y and Z axis every second in endless loop;
  - l3gd20_FIFO_example: demonstrates a reading of angular rates from the sensor configured in FIFO mode.

The library must be installed before compiling the examples. 

Build the examples from the command line by executing:
  #make 
or 
  #make all 
for compiling the two examples in one go.

Execute:
  #make l3gd20_single_meas_example 
for builing l3gd_single_meas_example.cpp code 

Execute:
  #make l3gd20_FIFO_example 
for building l3gd_FIFO_example.cpp

Cleaning the output files from the build:
  #make clean
